    <h3 align="middle"><i>Abstract</i></h3>
      <p>Simulating waterfalls accurately is a challenging technical task, but can produce aesthetically pleasing results. Waterfall simulations can add to the user experience in gaming and VR/AR applications. The technical tasks and contributions for this waterfall simulation involved implementing physics equations from 
        literature to calculate particle positions, optimizing simulation calculations, scene generation, and surface reconstruction. In the end we generated several different types of waterfall scenes with varied number of particles and objects.
      </p>

      
      
    <h3 align="middle"><i>Technical Approach</i></h3>
    <p>We used the Project 4 codebase as a starting point because it was nice to have an existing class hierarchy and GUI setup. From there, we updated the simulator and pointmass classes to implement the physics described below. </p>
    <h4 align="middle">Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) </h4>
    <p>In implementing proper particle dynamics for water, we used the paper <a href="https://www.scitepress.org/papers/2018/68965/68965.pdf">Particle based Waterfall Simulation with Spray Cloud Emerging from Basin</a> <b>[1]</b> as a guide. Their approach divides the waterfall up into a main water stream, splashing spray particles, and spray cloud particles, each with their own dynamics. In the time frame of this project, we were only able to implement the equations for water stream and spray cloud.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>Water Stream:</b></i> For these particles, we used Navier-Stokes to determine their acceleration. \[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + v\nabla^2 u + f \]
          Here \(u\) is velocity, \(t\) is time, \(\rho\) is density, \(p\) is pressure, \(v\) is viscosity and \(f\) is external acceleration. \(\nabla p\) represents the force density field due to pressure, \(v \nabla^2 u \) represents the force density field due to viscosity, and \(f\) represents external forces such as gravity, air resistance, or user interaction. In our case, we are simply using gravity. </p>

        <p>As part of SPH, each physical quanitity (i.e. density, pressure field, viscosity field) corresponding to an individual particle varies with time based on its neighbouring particles. The equations we use to calculate them follows <b>[2]</b>, which includes slight modifications to the traditional SPH quantity updates in order to make the forces symmetrical. These are defined as follows, where <i>j</i> denotes a neighboring particle of <i>i</i>:

          \[\rho(x_i) = \sum_{j} m_jW(x_i-x_j, h)\]
            \[\nabla p(x_i) = \sum_{j}m_j\frac{p_i + p_j}{2\rho_j}\nabla W(x_i-x_j, h)\] 
            \[\nabla^2 u(x_i) = \sum_{j} m_j \frac{u_j - u_i}{\rho_j} \nabla^2 W(x_i-x_j, h)\]

          The first equation should be evaluated before the latter two because of the dependence on density. As this summation of neighbors for each particle introduces a major computational bottleneck, we optimize neighborhood search as detailed in the optimization section below. 
          <p>\(W\) corresponds to a kernel smoothing function, of which there are many possible choices. For our project, we use the kernels defined in <b>[2]</b> based on their reported success and popularity, with a slight modification to the gradient kernel based on <b>[3]</b> that we found to produce more numerically stable results for our particular scene setups. </p>
          
          \[W(r,h) =
                   \frac{315}{64\pi h^9} \begin{cases}
                            (h^2-r^2)^3,  & \text{if $0 \le r \le h$} \\
                            0, & \text{otherwise}
                            \end{cases}\]

          \[\nabla W(r,h) =
          -\frac{45}{ \pi h^4}r \begin{cases}
                    (h-r)^2,  & \text{if $0 \le r \le h$} \\
                    0, & \text{otherwise}
                    \end{cases}\]         

          \[\nabla^2 W(r,h) =
          \frac{45}{\pi h^6} \begin{cases}
                    (h-r),  & \text{if $0 \le r \le h$} \\
                    0, & \text{otherwise}
                    \end{cases}\]                   

         <!--- <p>
          Gravity and air resistance are considered when computing the external acceleration \(f\) and can be computed as:
          \[f = g + \frac{1}{\rho_p V_p}F_{air}\]
          \[F_{air} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (\frac{D_p}{2})^2 \rho_a C_r |u_p| u_p\]

          \(g\) is gravity, \(\rho_p\), \(V_p\), \(D_p\), and \(u_p\) are the density, volume, diameter, and velocity of a particle. \(\rho_a\) and \(C_r\) are the density of air 
          and coefficient of air resistance. </p>-->


        </p>
        <p>
          Also note that a particle's pressure \(p_i\) needs to be given a value before we can update the pressure field. As suggested by [2], we use the ideal gas state equation

          \[
            p = k\rho
          \]

          in order to calculate a particle's pressure at each time step. Although they also suggest to offset this pressure by an initial density, we found that it was less numerically stable in practice then simply using the equation above.
        </p>
        <p> 
          To initialize the water stream particles, we had two different but similar methods depending on the type of scene we had. For a simple falling stream, we defined a small 3D rectangle by three finite ranges on the x/y/z axes and randomly initialized the given number of particles within that volume. For a stream falling off a plane to simulate the lip of a waterfall, we similarly initialize particles randomly along a defined volume, except the volume is defined with respect to the basis and normal vectors of a finite plane. Specifically, if \(v_1, v_2, n\) are the two basis vectors and the normal vectors of the finite plane, we draw coefficients \(a,b,c\) randomly from our three ranges to get a random point \(av_1 + bv_2 + cn \).
        </p>
        <br>


        <p><i><b>Splashing Spray: </b></i>When a stream particle hits an object or the basin, it can turns into a splashing spray particle to generate the "splash" effect of water interacting with objects. The inital velocity of the 
                                  splashing spray particle is the same value as that of colliding particle. We calculate additional forces to add to the external accelation used in Navier Stokes. </p>
        <p>\[F_r +F_b = \rho_p \frac{\pi}{6} D_p^3 \frac{\partial u_p}{dt} \]
           \[F_r = \frac{1}{2} \pi \frac{D_p}{2}^2 \rho_a C_r |u_a - u_p| (u_a - u_p)\] 
           \[F_b = (\rho_p - \rho_a) \frac{\pi D_p^3}{6}g\] 
           \(\rho_a \) and \(u_a \) are the desnity and velocity of air.
        </p>


        <p><i><b>Spray Cloud:</b></i> When a stream particle hits the basin, we generate a spray cloud particle with a random initial speed in the reflected direction. For these particles, we update their velocities using a modified Navier-Stokes as is done in <b>[1]</b>:
          
          \[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -(u \cdot \nabla) u  -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + v\nabla^2 u + f \]
          
          \[\nabla \cdot u = 0\]

          Vapor density was calculated by:

          \[\rho_v = 1.293*\frac{273.15}{273.15 + T} \frac{p}{1013.25}(1-0.378 \frac{e}{p})\]
         </p>

         <p><i>Simulation</i>: To update the particle positions after updating the accelerations of particles, we simply used Verlet Integration as in Project 4.
            \[x_{t+dt} = x_t + (1-d)*(x_t-x_{t-dt})+ a_t*dt^2 \]

         </p>

    <h4 align="middle">Optimization</h4>
    <p>One challenge with this project was ensuring that the simulation calculations were computed quickly. We utilized OpenMP to speed up parallelizable sections
      of the code.</p>

    <p>To compute the Navier Stokes equation, we need to determine the neighboring particles within a specified neighboorhood radius for every particle. Initially we utilized
      the CompactNSearch library for neighborhood search, but found that it was too computationally expensive. It would crash our machines if ran in conjunction with 
      the navier stokes computation. Thinking back to project 4, we looked into devising a spatial hashing approach. We found that it would be too inaccurate for 
      our purposes to use vanilla spatial hashing from project 4 so we utilized a method from <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~jihun/paper/sca2010.pdf">Reconstructing Surfaces of Particle-Based Fluids
        Using Anisotropic Kernels</a> <b>[4]</b>. The method works by computing an axis aligned bounding box for the ellipsoid associated with each particle. The ellipsoid is 
        calculated using an anisotropic kernel. The scene space is divided into grid cells (number and size of grid cells determined by a constant parameter). Whichever cells the bounding box intersects 
        are the ones the particle is mapped to in the spatial hashmap. Our hash functions hashes the grid cell which contains the particle with a linear formula 
        using large prime coefficients to avoid collisions.</p>
     <p>   
        Prior to implementing the ansiotropic kernel and constructing the bounding box, we used a sphere instead of the ellipsoid in order to get something up and running quickly. We computed the distance between 
        an external point and a grid cell to be \[d = \sqrt{\max(0, |x| -1)^2 + \max(0, |y|-1)^2 + \max(0, |z| - 1)^2} \] for a point with coordinates \(x\), \(y\), \(z\). 
     </p>

     <!--<p>Another method we tried</p> Jason, you can add the other method here if you want -->

    <h3 align="middle">Problems Encountered</h3>
    <h4 align="middle">Surface Reconstruction</h4>
    <p>
      Without GPU optimizations, the runtime of our simulation increases significantly as we increase the number of particles. However, the a particle-based simulation naturally behaves better and generates better visual effects when we are able to render more particles. As such, we attempted to find a middle ground between runtime and visual appeal by leaning on a method of particle-to-mesh reconstruction. Specifically, we attempted to use the original Marching Cubes algorithm <b>[5]</b> (which is referenced by many papers for particle-to-surface reconstruction) to triangulate a mesh of an isosurface based on a three-dimensional scalar field defined by the particle's physical quantities. For the function defining the isosurface, we use the following equation which is also used by <b>[2]</b>:


      \[ s(x_i) = \sum_j \frac{m_j}{\rho_j} W(x_i - x_j, h) \]

    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, we were unable to get this method to work in time before the project deadline. We suspect that we need to examine the function defining the isosurface a little closer, potentially tweaking the simulation parameters and surface-defining isolevel in order to get better results using this particular function. Alternatively, there may be better isosurface definitions to use, such as that which is described in <b>[4]</b>.
    </p>

    <h4 align="middle">SPH Implementation and Stability</h4>
    <p>
      The description of Navier-Stokes in the waterfall specific reference <b>[1]</b> was slightly ambiguous in terms of implementation, possibly because the intended audience has a greater familiarity with fluid simulations. As such, we turned to many other works in the field of general particle-based fluid simulation such as <b>[2]</b>, <b>[3]</b>, <b>[6]</b>, and <b>[7]</b> to better understand the equations and how others go about implementing them. In these works, the implementations vary in many ways (e.g. the kernel function, the pressure/viscosity numerical calculation), leading us to experiment with various configurations. Through trial and error, we found that the mix of features from each of these works described earlier gave us the best visual effects within the context of our scene. However, we would have liked to see whether any individual work's full configuration could have been made to produce even better results with more time to debug and tweak parameter, so this remains an interesting future line of investigation. 
    </p>
    
    <h3 align="middle"><i>Results</i></h3>



    

    <p>
        In our simulation, we initialize 1000 water stream particles that fall off an invisible object. After each particle hits the ground below, it is reset to a starting position at the top of the simulation. This gives us the illusion of water constantly flowing into the scene without having to continuously create new particles. As the simulation progresses, spray cloud and splashing spray particles are added and removed as described in our section above. While the number of water stream particles is held constant at 1000, because of how spray cloud and splashing spray particles are created, the actual number of particles in our simulation at any given time step is around 2-3x more.

    <h3 align="middle"><i>Lessons Learned</i></h3>
    <p>It was interesting to take the high level concepts we learned from the cloth simulation project and apply it to simulating fluid particles with help from the literature. While researching the various methods, we learned how to better decipher papers in order to deal with amibguities and left-out details. In the process, we gained a better understanding of the physics behind how fluids work and appreciation for how sensitive the computational parameters need to be in order for the simulation to work properly.  Overall, we learned that there are a lot of complexities that go into creating a realistic waterfall simulation, and would love investigate the open-ends of our project further when we have more time.
